# Schemas

Schemas keep Sapling OS greppable and searchable as it scales.

## Why Schemas?

Every file in `brain/` follows a schema. This means:

- **Consistent structure** - Files of the same type always have the same frontmatter fields
- **Searchable** - You can `grep` for any field across hundreds of files
- **Parseable** - Scripts can reliably extract and process data
- **Validated** - The schema hook ensures Claude always writes files correctly

Without schemas, your vault becomes a mess of inconsistent formats that breaks tooling.

## How It Works

### 1. Schema Definitions (`vault/`)

Each file type has a YAML schema defining:
- Required and optional frontmatter fields
- Field types and validation rules
- File location and naming patterns
- Purpose and usage notes

```
schemas/vault/
├── call.yaml       # Call notes
├── entity.yaml     # People, companies
├── inbox.yaml      # Tasks pending action
├── library.yaml    # Saved content
├── output.yaml     # Posts, PRDs, deliverables
├── trace.yaml      # Decision traces
└── ...
```

### 2. Schema Hook

When Claude creates or edits files in `brain/`, a hook validates the output against the schema. If something's wrong, it catches it immediately.

This means you never end up with malformed files—Claude writes it right the first time, every time.

### 3. Migrations (`migrations/`)

When a schema updates (new fields, renamed fields, restructured data), a migration is generated:

```
migrations/
├── trace-1.0.0-to-1.1.0.md
├── trace-1.1.0-to-1.2.0.md
├── library-legacy-to-1.2.0.md
└── ...
```

Run `/migrate` to update old files to the current schema version. This keeps your entire vault consistent even as the system evolves.

## Quick Reference

| Schema | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `call` | `brain/calls/` | Call notes and meeting records |
| `entity` | `brain/entities/` | People and company profiles |
| `inbox` | `brain/inbox/` | Tasks pending human action |
| `library` | `brain/library/` | Saved articles, resources |
| `output` | `brain/outputs/` | Deliverables (posts, PRDs, emails) |
| `trace` | `brain/traces/` | Decision traces for calibration |
| `daily-note` | `brain/notes/daily/` | Daily notes |
| `weekly-note` | `brain/notes/weekly/` | Weekly reviews |

## Commands

- `/migrate` - Run pending migrations on outdated files
- `/migrate --detect` - Show which files need migration

## Adding New Schemas

1. Create `schemas/vault/{name}.yaml` with full definition
2. Include `schema_version`, `changelog`, field definitions
3. The hook picks it up automatically

See existing schemas for the format.
