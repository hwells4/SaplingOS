</objective>

<workflow>
## Phase 1: Welcome & Introduction

### Step 1: Get Their Name
Start by learning who they are. Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
question: "First things first—what should I call you?"
header: "Your name"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Use my system username"
    description: "I'll call you by your computer's username"
  - label: "Something else"
    description: "Type your preferred name (click Other)"
```

**On selection:**
- If "Use my system username": Extract from environment, store as `name`
- If "Something else" or "Other": Use the provided text as `name`

### Step 2: Welcome & Set Expectations
Now that you have their name, give a warm welcome:

```
Hey {name}! Welcome to Sapling OS.

This setup takes about 3-5 minutes. I'm going to ask you a few questions
to tailor this system to your preferences and get you started on the right foot.

Here's what we'll cover:
  1. Pick your companion creature (the fun part!)
  2. Learn a bit about your work
  3. Set up optional features
  4. Generate your personal context files

Everything except the creature is skippable—you can always add more later.
Ready? Let's go!
```

### Step 3: Creature Selection (Required)
Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
question: "Choose your elemental egg. It will hatch into your companion creature after your first calibration."
header: "Creature"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "🔥 Fire Egg"
    description: "Hatches into Ember. Burns through blockers, iterates fast."
  - label: "💧 Water Egg"
    description: "Hatches into Drift. Flows around obstacles, adaptable."
  - label: "🌿 Nature Egg"
    description: "Hatches into Bloom. Grows organically, cultivates knowledge."
```

**On selection:**
1. Map selection to creature name (ember/drift/bloom)
2. Update `.claude/stats.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   creature: ember  # or drift/bloom
   creature_selected_at: 2025-01-08
   ```
3. Show creature egg art from `.claude/creatures/{name}/egg.txt`
4. Brief message: "Great choice! {Creature} will grow alongside you."

## Phase 2: Understanding Your Work

### Step 4: Business Context
Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
question: "Do you run a business or have a company website I can learn from?"
header: "Business"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Yes, I have a website"
    description: "I'll pull context from your site (enter URL via Other)"
  - label: "Yes, but no website"
    description: "I'll ask a few questions instead"
  - label: "No, this is personal use"
    description: "Skip business context"
```

**If "Yes, I have a website":**
1. They should enter the URL via the "Other" option
2. If they selected this but didn't enter a URL, prompt: "What's your website URL?"
3. WebFetch the website (try /about page if exists)
4. Extract: company name, description, industry indicators
5. Store for business.md generation
6. On failure: "Couldn't load that—no worries, I'll ask a couple questions instead."

**If "Yes, but no website":**
Ask follow-up via AskUserQuestion:
```yaml
question: "What does your business do? (One sentence is fine)"
header: "Business"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Consulting/Services"
    description: "I help clients with specific expertise"
  - label: "Product/SaaS"
    description: "I build and sell a product"
  - label: "Agency/Creative"
    description: "I do creative or marketing work"
  - label: "Other"
    description: "Describe via Other option"
```
Store response for business.md.

**If "No, this is personal use":** Mark `business_skipped: true`, continue

### Step 5: Your Role
Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
question: "What best describes your role?"
header: "Role"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Founder/CEO"
    description: "I run the show"
  - label: "Engineer/Developer"
    description: "I build things"
  - label: "Designer/Creative"
    description: "I design and create"
  - label: "Other"
    description: "Something else (describe via Other)"
```

Store for about-me.md.

### Step 6: Primary Use Case
Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
question: "What are you most hoping Sapling OS helps you with?"
header: "Use case"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Task & project management"
    description: "Stay organized, track work"
  - label: "Writing & content"
    description: "Blog posts, docs, communication"
  - label: "Client work"
    description: "Manage clients, calls, deliverables"
  - label: "Personal productivity"
    description: "Notes, ideas, life organization"
```

Store for preferences.md.

### Step 7: Writing Samples (Optional)
Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
question: "Got any writing samples I can analyze? Blog posts, articles, tweets—helps me learn your voice."
header: "Writing"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Yes, I have some URLs"
    description: "Enter 1-3 URLs via Other"
  - label: "Skip for now"
    description: "My voice can be learned over time"
```

**If URLs provided:**
1. WebFetch each URL (comma-separated)
2. Analyze: sentence length, formality, common phrases
3. Store for voice-and-style.md
4. On failure: Note partial success, continue

**If "Skip":** Mark `writing_skipped: true`, continue

## Phase 3: Optional Features

### Step 8: Image Generation Setup
Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
question: "Want to set up image generation? Great for creating slide decks, LinkedIn carousels, and graphics."
header: "Images"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Yes, set it up (~2 min)"
    description: "I'll walk you through getting a free Gemini API key"
  - label: "Skip for now"
    description: "I can set this up anytime"
```

**If "Yes, set it up":**

1. Display setup instructions:
   ```
   To generate images, you need a free Gemini API key from Google.

   Steps:
   1. Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
   2. Sign in with your Google account
   3. Click "Create API Key"
   4. Copy the key (starts with "AIza...")
   ```

2. Use AskUserQuestion:
   ```yaml
   question: "Paste your Gemini API key (stays local, never committed to git)"
   header: "API Key"
   multiSelect: false
   options:
     - label: "I have my key"
       description: "Paste it via Other"
     - label: "Skip for now"
       description: "I'll set this up later"
   ```

3. **On key provided** (via "Other"):
   - Validate key format (should start with "AIza" and be ~39 chars)
   - Create `.env.local`:
     ```
     # Gemini API key for image generation (nano-banana)
     # Get yours at: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
     GEMINI_API_KEY=<their-key>
     ```
   - Create `.claude/skills/generate-visuals/.env` with same content
   - Confirm: "Image generation is ready!"

**If "Skip":** Mark `image_gen_skipped: true`, continue

## Phase 4: Generate Context Files

### Step 9: Generate Files
Create files in `brain/context/` using templates from `templates/`:

**about-me.md:**
- Name from Step 1
- Role from Step 5
- Any extracted/provided background
- TODOs for missing sections

**business.md:**
- Company data from website (if fetched)
- Business type from follow-ups
- TODOs for missing sections

**voice-and-style.md:**
- Writing sample analysis (if provided)
- Defaults + TODOs if skipped

**preferences.md:**
- Primary use case from Step 6
- Tool preferences (defaults)
- TODOs for expansion

## Phase 5: Explain & Complete

### Step 10: Explain How It Works

```
How Sapling OS Works:

1. **Your Context Files** (brain/context/)
   These files help me understand you. I reference them when helping
   with tasks, writing in your voice, or making recommendations.

2. **Decision Tracing** (/task)
   When you start work with /task, I track meaningful decisions—not
   what you did, but *why* you chose one approach over another.

3. **Calibration** (/calibrate)
   This is the magic. Run /calibrate periodically and I'll:
   - Review your decision traces
   - Identify patterns in your preferences
   - Propose updates to my skills and behaviors
   - Tailor myself to work the way YOU work

   After 10 decision traces, your egg hatches!

4. **Daily Notes** (/today)
   Start each day with /today to capture tasks and context.
   This becomes the memory that makes me more useful over time.

The more you use it, the better it gets.
```

### Step 11: Show Welcome Banner
```

```

### Step 12: Commit with /commit

Use the `/commit` skill to save all onboarding files:

**Files to stage:**
- `brain/context/*.md` - Generated context files
- `.claude/stats.yaml` - Creature selection and timestamps

**Do NOT stage:**
- `.env.local` - Contains API keys
- `.claude/skills/generate-visuals/.env` - Contains API keys
- `.claude/onboard-state.json` - Temporary state file

Invoke `/commit` - it will create an appropriate commit message.

### Step 13: Clean Up & Next Steps
- Delete `.claude/onboard-state.json` if exists
- Mark onboarding complete in stats.yaml: `onboarded_at: {date}`

```
Ready to get started? Here's what to do next:

  /today     - Create your first daily note
  /task      - Start a task (decisions get traced!)
  /calibrate - Run after 10+ traces to hatch your egg

Your egg is waiting. Let's get to work!
```
</workflow>

<state_persistence>
Save state after each step to `.claude/onboard-state.json`:

```json
{
  "started_at": "2025-01-08T10:00:00Z",
  "name": "Harrison",
  "creature": "ember",
  "completed_steps": ["name", "welcome", "creature", "business", "role", "usecase", "writing", "image_gen"],
  "collected_data": {
    "company_url": "https://example.com",
    "company_extracted": {...},
    "business_type": "consulting",
    "role": "founder",
    "use_case": "client_work",
    "writing_skipped": true,
    "image_gen_configured": true
  },
  "current_step": "generate_files"
}
```

On resume, load state and skip to `current_step`.
